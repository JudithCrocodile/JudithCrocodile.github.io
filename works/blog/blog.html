        <h2>This Is My First Article</h2>
        <p>Like beef, pork is divided into primal, or wholesale, cuts that refer to the part of the animal they come from. Pork is further subdivided into retail cuts, which are the ones found in the supermarket. For fresh pork, the cut determines the fat
            content and cooking method.</p>
        <p>Only one-third of the pork produced each year is sold fresh. The rest is cured, smoked, or processed. Curing was once a method of preserving meat so that it would be available throughout the winter. Today, pork is cured for flavor, and though
            the method lengthens cured pork’s storage life, most cured pork must be kept refrigerated.</p>
        <p>Fresh and cured pork are very different, therefore they are discussed separately below.</p>

        <h2>This Is Another Article</h2>
        <p>Pork leg: Fresh hams come from the leg of the hog. The whole leg can be sold as a ham that weighs 10 to 14 pounds. More often, it is divided into butt half and shank half, the butt half of which is much meatier. These cuts are sold with or without
            the bone. You may also find top leg (inside roast). Sometimes slices are cut from the leg and sold as pork cutlets. The leg can be roasted or braised, and leg cutlets can be broiled, braised, or sautéed.</p>
        <p>Pork loin: This part of the pig supplies the largest number of fresh cuts and also the leanest, with meat that is tender and flavorful. The loin is divided into three parts: blade loin, nearest the shoulder; center loin; and sirloin, nearest the
            leg. You may also find top loin chops and center loin cutlets. The cuts from either end are not as tender as the center loin, and thus the center loin is the most expensive. You’ll find both roasts and chops with or without the bone. Thick
            chops—an inch or more in thickness—can be broiled, sautéed, or braised. Roasts can be roasted or braised.</p>
        <p>Pork tenderloin: The tenderloin comes from the center loin. It is often sold on its own as a roast, and is included as part of loin or sirloin chops. It is about a foot long and 2 inches in diameter at its thickest point. It’s well worth the price—the
            meat is exceptionally tender, and the tenderloin is the leanest cut of fresh pork. Roast or braise the whole tenderloin. It cooks rapidly. Or slice it into medallions and sauté the slices.</p>
        <p>Pork crown roast: The loin is also the source of the impressive crown roast, which is two center rib roasts fastened together in a circle to form a hollow that can be stuffed and then roasted. Crown roasts are usually ordered from a butcher, since
            the backbone must be removed or cracked and the rib ends must be trimmed. The shoulder end of the loin produces country-style ribs, which are not true spareribs (spareribs come from the side). Meatier and leaner than spareribs, they can be
            braised, broiled, or roasted.</p>
